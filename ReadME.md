# 🎹 Piano_Project

This is a full-stack project that simulates a 12-note piano covering the 3rd octave. It includes interactive UI elements styled with CSS and dynamic sound playback using JavaScript.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main structure of the piano layout.
- `style.css` – Styling for the keys, background, and animations (including animated gradient text for the title).
- `script.js` – Handles the audio playback, visual key press effects, and interactivity.
- `notes/` – Contains all 12 sound files (MP3 format) corresponding to each note (C to B including sharps/flats).

## 🎯 Purpose

I built this project as part of my learning journey toward becoming a **full-stack developer**, following along with a hands-on **Udemy course**.

## ✅ Features

- 🎼 12-note piano (3rd octave)
- 🎨 Gradient-animated "Piano" title
- 🎹 Visual key press animations
- 🔊 Audio playback with responsive key design

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Understand and apply DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript
- Work with HTML5 `<audio>` elements for real-time sound playback
- Use Flexbox and gradients for clean, modern UI layouts
- Animate text and UI components using CSS keyframes
- Build a fully interactive browser-based application with clean structure

## 📌 Next Steps

- Expand the keyboard to **5 octaves** to simulate a full piano on one screen
- Add keyboard bindings for physical key-to-note mapping
- Introduce recording and playback functionality
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
